Overview of Project
Objective:
The objective of this project is todesign FSM's using verilog or VHDL in the software environment. To test different states and transitions of the FSM and to simulate and verify its correctness
key Activities:
To represent some function inform of i/o that have some finite states
Technologies used:
Verilog HDL: Hardware description language to implement digital design
